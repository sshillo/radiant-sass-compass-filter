This filter adds a sass filter to the admin ui. This filter is really only meant to be used
with pages and page parts. Syntax errors are displayed when used here. The @import statement
works with absolute paths from root based upon a pages slug. For example suppose the current page setup also assume slugs are same as name
/
--About
----Me
--SomeOtherPage

To import About use @import /About
To import Me use @import About/Me
There is no checking for the formal sass underscore before imported file and imported files and be named
whatever you want just remember to base import off the slug.

I used Sean Cribbs' sass filter as a starting point, many thanks.

TODO add compass and blueprint frameworks and relative urls if possible

KNOWN BUGS
  When adding a new page part, and error "default partial not found" will come up
  for the moment just continue as usual, the error will go away upon saving, it doesn't effect anything
