At present this extension will add a sass filter to the admin ui with syntax error checking
which is displayed in the admin ui. It is planned to add add the compass and blueprint libraries 
so the they may be easily included from the admin ui.

I used Sean Cribbs' sass filter as a starting point, many thanks.
